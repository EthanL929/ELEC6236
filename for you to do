The CycloneÂ® V FPGA core architecture comprises the following:

Up to 300K equivalent logic elements (LEs) arranged as vertical columns of adaptive logic modules (ALMs).
Up to 12 Mb of embedded memory arranged as 10 Kb (M10K) blocks.
Up to 1.7 Mb of distributed memory logic array blocks (MLABs).
Up to 342 variable-precision digital signal processing (DSP) blocks that can implement up to 684 18x18 embedded multipliers.
Eight fractional clock synthesis phase-locked loops (PLLs).
